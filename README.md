To alter the simulation parameters open the file "SimulationParameters.csv" and each value corresponds to the title above. The minimum required number of steps is 100. The VMD is how often the script should write the positions and times to the trajectory.xyz file. It is most accurate when the number of steps is an integer multiple of the VMD step.</br>
